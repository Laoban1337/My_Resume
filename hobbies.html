    <p>In my spare time when I am not coding or busy with life, 
    I find myself playing a lot of video games. One of my all time favorite game is Path of exile. <br>
    it is like diablo but entirely more complex then the aforementioned. I let it take more time from me than I would like to admit.

        I just recently got into Archery! It has been one of the most fun times I have had outdoors <br>
        Mostly target practice, but I hope to good enough one day to take it hunting(no offense meant to my vegan friends) <br>
        I love anything that will get me outside and in nature
